Subject: Petition for Immediate Action Regarding Mismanagement of Thapar Food Festival and Artist Misrepresentation<br />
Dear DOSA,<br />
I am writing on behalf of the concerned students of Thapar University regarding the mismanagement of the recent food festival event. The purpose of this petition is to highlight the unethical behavior displayed by the organizing committee in their handling of the festival, particularly the misrepresentation of the event headlining artist, resulting in a situation that has left both the students and the artist feeling cheated and disrespected.<br />

As you are likely aware, the food festival, a highly anticipated event, was marred by the fraudulent representation of the headlining artist. The organizing committee advertised and sold tickets for the event on the basis of a specific artist being slated to perform, creating an expectation among the student body. However, to our dismay and shock, the event featured a completely different artist, not the one that was initially advertised. This clear misrepresentation has not only caused disappointment and resentment among the students but has also led to the public shaming of our college's reputation.

The situation further escalated when the initially promoted artist took to social media, specifically Instagram, to expose the mismanagement and dishonest practices of the event organizers. His public stories highlighted the deceitful conduct of the committee, further tarnishing the college's image and credibility.

This misrepresentation not only resulted in financial loss for many students who purchased tickets under false pretenses but also inflicted emotional distress due to the sheer disappointment and breach of trust. The actions of the organizing committee have not only impacted the student body but have also harmed the reputation and credibility of our esteemed institution.

We, the concerned students, request immediate action to rectify this situation and prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. It is imperative that strict measures are taken against the individuals responsible for this deceitful conduct. These measures should include, but are not limited to, a thorough investigation into the event management team, accountability for their actions, and measures to compensate the students who were affected by this misrepresentation.

We believe that the collegeâ€™s integrity and the trust of its students should be upheld at all times. It is our collective request that the administration takes stringent action to address this issue and ensure that such unethical conduct does not occur in any future college events. Additionally, measures to compensate the students who were misled should be taken into account.

We sincerely hope that you take this matter seriously and expedite the actions necessary to restore faith in the college's event management and uphold the institution's esteemed reputation.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Dhruv
Student TIET
